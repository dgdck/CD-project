## Report of assignment

### Deploy keys

Deploying keys was the first roadblock I encountered. After reading the theory it still didn't work immediately.
The first result I got was: *Error: Permission denied (publickey).*
Solved after the following:

* I had to move the private and public key to the default folder after generating them.
* Then adding them to the ssh-agent identity.


### Github secrets

After reading some information on github I made the .yml-file.
To login the VPS trough Github actions I understood I needed to use secrets. I couldn't workout how to use the github secrets, I thought I could use only one.
So I searched on the marketplace to use a program to login the VPS with Github action. When I found [appleboy/ssh-action](https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action) it became clear for me how to use the secrets. I followed that recommendation from appleboy to set it up and I could successfully login the VPS to execute the commands I wanted.
