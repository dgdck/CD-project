# Create a new file greet.py, and in that file implement a function
# supergreeting that takes a name as an argument (str) and returns
# a string of the form 'Hellooo...ooo, Bob!'.
# Then import this function in main.py and write a function
# supergreeting_wrapper that takes the exact same type of argument,
# calls supergreeting with it and returns the result.

def supergreeting(name):
    return 'Hellooo...ooo, ' + name + '!'
